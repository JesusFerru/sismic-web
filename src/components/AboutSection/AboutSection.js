								The Apollo missions, undertaken by NASA between
								1969 and 1972, were a monumental achievement in
								human history. These missions not only marked
								the first successful human landings on the Moon
								but also provided invaluable scientific data
								that deepened our understanding of Earth's
								celestial neighbor. Among the many scientific
								experiments conducted during the Apollo
								missions, the recording of lunar seismic events
								stands out as a significant contribution to
								lunar science. These seismic recordings have
								unearthed a wealth of knowledge about the Moon's
								geological history, structure, and evolution.
								<br />
								<br />
								The Apollo missions deployed a series of
								seismometers on the lunar surface during Apollo
								11, 12, 14, 15, and 16 missions. These
								seismometers were collectively part of the
								Apollo Lunar Surface Experiments Package
								(ALSEP), and they recorded seismic activities on
								the Moon for extended periods. The primary goal
								of these experiments was to investigate the
								moon's internal structure, tectonic activity,
								and the nature of lunar earthquakes, also known
								as "moonquakes."
								<br />
								<br />
								Moonquakes, as recorded by the seismometers,
								were classified into two main categories: deep
								moonquakes and shallow moonquakes. Deep
								moonquakes were characterized by their origin in
								the deep lunar interior, often several hundred
								kilometers below the surface. These events were
								more akin to tectonic activity on Earth, and
								they provided vital insights into the Moon's
								internal dynamics. Shallow moonquakes, on the
								other hand, occurred relatively close to the
								lunar surface. These were generally weaker than
								deep moonquakes but were more frequent. The
								seismometers detected thousands of shallow
								moonquakes during their operational lifetimes.
								The exact cause of these shallow moonquakes
								remains a subject of scientific investigation,
								with potential triggers including meteorite
								impacts, thermal stress, or the gravitational
								pull of Earth.
								<br />
								<br />
								The seismic data recorded by the Apollo missions
								allowed scientists to develop a detailed picture
								of the Moon's internal structure. By analyzing
								the propagation of seismic waves through the
								lunar interior, researchers were able to
								estimate the composition and thickness of the
								Moon's crust, mantle, and potentially even a
								partially molten layer deep beneath the surface.
								One of the most surprising discoveries was the
								existence of a partially molten layer or "magma
								ocean" beneath the lunar surface. This finding
								challenged earlier assumptions about the Moon's
								interior and raised intriguing questions about
								its geological history and early volcanic
								activity.
								<br />
								<br />
								The seismic data collected by the Apollo
								missions continue to be a valuable resource for
								lunar scientists. The recorded moonquakes, their
								frequencies, and patterns of occurrence have
								been revisited and reanalyzed with modern
								scientific techniques. These studies have
								expanded our understanding of the Moon's current
								geological stability and potential implications
								for future lunar missions and lunar base
								construction. Looking ahead, the Apollo seismic
								experiments have paved the way for future lunar
								exploration initiatives. New missions, such as
								NASA's Artemis program, aim to return humans to
								the Moon and establish a sustainable presence.
								The lessons learned from the Apollo seismic
								experiments will inform the design and execution
								of future experiments and instruments aimed at
								unraveling more lunar mysteries.
								<br />
								<br />
								In the realm of lunar seismology, two
								significant contributions are worth mentioning.
								Nakamura's 1979 catalogue and Lognonné's 2003
								catalogue have played pivotal roles in
								cataloging and analyzing lunar seismic events.
								Nakamura's work from 1979 laid the foundation by
								meticulously documenting and categorizing a
								range of lunar quakes. Decades later, Lognonné's
								2003 catalogue expanded upon Nakamura's
								pioneering efforts, incorporating additional
								data from more recent lunar missions. These
								comprehensive catalogues serve as essential
								references for researchers, aiding in the
								ongoing exploration and understanding of lunar
								seismic activity.
								<br />
								<br />
								The recording of lunar seismic events by the
								Apollo missions remains a remarkable scientific
								achievement. These experiments have yielded
								critical insights into the Moon's internal
								structure, tectonic activity, and geological
								history. As we continue our journey to explore
								the cosmos and plan for future lunar
								exploration, the legacy of the Apollo seismic
								experiments serves as a testament to the
								enduring quest for knowledge about our celestial
								neighbors. The data collected during those
								missions will continue to inspire and inform the
								next generation of lunar scientists and
								explorers.
								<br />
								<br />
								This immense legacy is what inspired our team to
								participate in NASA's International Space Apps
								Challenge and to build LUNA, in order to
								visualize the seismic events from Nakamura's and
								Lognonné's catalogues. We hope that LUNA
								will help educate and inspire future lunar
								enthusiasts and scientists.
